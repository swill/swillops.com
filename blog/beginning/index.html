                <h2>From the beginning...<br> <small>From the beginning...</small></h2>
                <hr>
                <p>I started working with web based development and design when I was 16. I
started out working mainly with graphic design and then moving more towards
web development as I got closer to heading off to university.</p>

<p>In 2005 I got my bachelors degree from McGill University in Computer Science.
I had done quite a bit of freelance work with the web while I was in school,
but I wasn&rsquo;t really considering it as a career at the time. I thought it would
be smart to become a &ldquo;developer&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;web developer&rdquo;, so when I
graduated I started working for a pretty big company coding in C# on .NET. It
didn&rsquo;t take me long to realize that I don&rsquo;t think the way that &lsquo;versioned&rsquo;
software developers think. Added to that, this was my first experience working
with a big company. I had no control over our shipped product, I was just a
cog in a big (inefficient) machine. I realized that I had not become a
&ldquo;developer&rdquo; at all, but a &ldquo;programmer&rdquo;. You may be thinking that there is no
difference between the two, so let me clarify my point. I was once told, &ldquo;a
software developer is like a poet or a painter. They all start with a blank
piece of paper and their only limit is their imagination&rdquo;. I find this very
true. As a software developer you are dealing directly with a client and you
are working together with them to solve their problems in the best way
possible. By intimately understanding the clients needs you have more freedom
to be creative and build an elegant solution. On the flip side, as a
programmer you have very little freedom. You are given a strict set of
specifications that need to be implemented and your job is to build it. The
problem is, most of the time this set of specifications has gone through about
6 levels of documentation, from a high level estimate all the way down to the
technical spec document that you were handed. The client is often only
consulted for the first half of that documentation process, so it is very
possible that right from the beginning you are not even building what the
client needs. Of course, when the client is not happy with the end result, the
programmer takes all the flak. Being a very entrepreneurial person, this
setting really was not working out for me. I began looking into the web
environment again because I had always enjoyed working in that field. In my
research to get caught up with all the new happenings in this industry I
realized that my year and a half away from web development had put me way
behind. I knew right away that I was in the wrong industry and started taking
steps to correct my previous decisions.</p>

<p>Update: I have quit my job and started working for a small company as a web
developer and it has been amazing. I work too much now days, but I couldn&rsquo;t be
happier&hellip;</p>

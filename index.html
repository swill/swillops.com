    <p><p>Traditional web hosting and web application frameworks have become a bit of an annoyance for me.  If you use Wordpress or Drupal you likely can sympathize with the never ending stream of updates and such.  Many of them actually make your site less stable.  Then there is the problem of keeping your site backed up in case your cheap hosting provider accidentally deletes all your work.  Well no more&hellip;</p>

<p>I am now managing the content of this website in static markdown files compiled with <a href="http://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> and then hosted for free using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">gh-pages</a>.  This is how I did it&hellip;</p>

        <small>Git branches to manage third party app customization</small>
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Preface: I have been using this technique to customize different types of third party projects for years. I originally wrote about it back in 2009 in this popular post regarding the management of customizations on top of the ever changing Drupal code base. That post is very long winded and overly technical for most people, this post will serve as an abridged version covering only the branching concept. The Problem: A third party has developed some code you would like to leverage, however, you require customizations to their code for your implementation.</p>

        <small>Redirect traffic from a wordpress site</small>
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The Problem: A wordpress site has depreciated and you want to redirect all of its traffic to a landing page on a new site. However, you want to explain why the site has been deprecated in the context of the old site. The Solution: You should explain to the user why they are being redirected, so create a page on the old wordpress site at some url, say: www.oldsite.com/we- moved On that new page (/we-moved), we want it to have a countdown and then redirect to the new landing page at, say: www.newsite.com/welcome- oldsite To do the redirect, put the following jQuery/javascript on the &lsquo;we-moved&rsquo; page: &lt;div&gt;Redirecting in &lt;span class=&quot;redirect-in&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; seconds...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; jQuery(document).ready(function($) { var countdown = setInterval(function(){ sec=parseInt($(&quot;.redirect-in&quot;).html()); if (sec != 0) { $(&quot;.redirect-in&quot;).html(sec-1); } else { // countdown is finished...</p>

Download and install the latest node.js.

    <hr>
    <p>Snow Leopard comes with PHP 5.3 installed by default. Since I do a lot of Drupal development, I can&rsquo;t actually use that version of PHP and I needed to downgrade to PHP 5.2.x. I personally do not like the way that Apple has setup their AMP stack, so this is how I was able to get an acceptable one setup. Note: This method uses MacPorts, so you will need to install that first.</p>

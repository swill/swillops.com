      <title>Old Media vs New Media</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With many new types of media available online, the newspaper industry has been
loosing traction and are being forced to downsize. Is this just an inevitable
chain of events due to the onset of the information age, or do newspapers
still hold a valuable market and just need to adjust their thinking? I think
that the newspaper industry has a solid product and will continue to have a
market, but I feel that their market is changing and they need to reevaluate
their approach to the editorial consumer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web logs (blogs) have developed a massive reader base in the past few years.
They are easy to access and are often quicker than newspapers to publish
breaking news. Many blogs are directed at a specific field of knowledge, so if
you are interested in one of the articles you will most likely be interested
in others by the same author. Many authors have become very well known and
their work is checked on a regular basis or referenced with regard to their
topic of expertise. Authors build a reputation and credibility through the
quality of their work, but do not have an obligation to produce content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newspaper columnists, on the other hand, are paid by newspaper companies and
must create content in order to keep their jobs. The newspaper industry is
therefor paying for consistent and quality journalism through infrastructure
and must keep up sales if it is going to stay in business. The one major thing
that I feel is lacking in the newspapers approach and presentation is the
human aspect. They have tried to centralize their view to be &amp;ldquo;the paper&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo;
view and with that have not been presenting their contributors well enough. It
is difficult to know exactly who wrote the article you are reading in a paper
because you only have a name and picture to go on. Unless you follow a
specific writer&amp;rsquo;s work, you have no frame of reference to fully understand
their stance. This is an area where I feel the blogisphere excels. Because the
majority of the writing done in blogs are opinion pieces, writers must build
credibility as a person in order for anyone to take them seriously. Newspapers
already have the initial credibility, so why haven&amp;rsquo;t they tried to create
personal credibility for their writers and create aggregated environments of
their work? A lot of this comes down to the way the newspaper industry has
tried to adapt to blogs entering the market. They have taken a head on
approach, mainly because they have an arrogance about the quality of their
content and feel that they should not have to compete on the same level. If
you really think about this, it is an amazing situation for the newspapers
because the majority of blogs are flooding a large amount of lower quality
content into the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do newspaper companies have to gain and loose from presenting their
writers online and giving them an online credibility? They would tell you that
they would loose potential sales because they are releasing the same content
free online, so why would anyone pay for it? The truth of the matter is that
newspapers have a huge tactile advantage to blogs. Once you know which writers
you like and who they write for, you are more likely to buy the paper to read
in a coffee shop. Unlike a laptop, if you get get ketchup on a paper you
probably won&amp;rsquo;t go insane. People already spend more time than they would like
in front of their computer, so they will take advantage of the chance to catch
up on their favorite reading without going bug eyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newspaper companies are already having to lay off employees because of reduced
sales. I feel that the jobs being lost are a direct result of their inability
to adapt to the information age and by not taking the initiative to compete in
the new technology market. They are set in their ways and are not paying
attention to the current trends in the population. There is not a future in
cutting down large areas of trees to feed paper mills which pollute our
environment so that a newspaper can to placed on every person&amp;rsquo;s doorstep every
morning. A large percentage of these papers are never even read and are just
tossed in the recycling bin (if not worse, the trash). The newspaper industry
needs to become an on demand service with improved social interests if it
expects to be able to compete in the upcoming era&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Re:Web of Mediocrity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Juan Rodriguez wrote an article in the Montreal Gazette titled the &amp;lsquo;Web of
Mediocrity&amp;rsquo; which I found somewhat obtuse. Here is my response to that
article.&lt;br /&gt;
(The article is only available online for paying members, so you will have had
to have read it in paper form for proper context&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Rodriguez,&lt;br /&gt;
I read your article in the gazette and I have some contentions with your
arguments/opinions. I have a very different view on the topic, so I wanted to
present my understanding of the Web and its effect on our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where should I start? I guess we might as well put a time frame on this so we
are talking about the same thing. The Web was created almost 20 years ago and
has been growing at an amazing rate. It has pretty much defined our transition
from the Industrial Age to the Information Age. It allows for the sharing of
ideas on all levels quickly and efficiently. Because of this, the Web has
attracted audiences of all types. Businesses can run smoother, teachers can
better educate and pretty much any old Joe can share their knowledge,
creativity and opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does this shape our culture and society? I think that the economy plays
one of the biggest roles in shaping a society, so lets look at that to start.
When you think of the Web and economics, the first thing that probably comes
to mind is the &amp;ldquo;dot com&amp;rdquo; era/bust around the year 2000. A lot of companies
realized that they needed to be &amp;ldquo;web enabled&amp;rdquo; and ran full force into it
without really understanding how web enabled businesses function. Because of
this many companies bought or developed very poor solutions to their problems
and ran into major issues when their chosen software couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep up with the
changing technology and market. Many companies went broke while a lot of
companies ended up squeaking by without getting hit too hard and took the
experience as an expensive web tutorial. There were a few companies who
understood the changing times and capitalized on the market, and the likes of
Google, Amazon and eBay were born. These companies understood the concept of
Software as a Service (SaaS) and built web frameworks to capitalize on the
huge demanding market of consumers who where itching to be served by the web.
These companies have become household names but the full potential of the web
is not limited to there achievements. Every day new companies are starting to
understand the Web&amp;rsquo;s potential and begin working to ensure their spot in the
growing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand why the Web is changing the rules, I have to discuss for
a minute &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail&#34;&gt;Long Tail&lt;/a&gt; economics
(and yes I just linked a wikipedia page). The Long Tail refers to the fact
that only a few companies make most of today&amp;rsquo;s products and a very large
number of companies only make a small number of products (these companies are
the long tail). The companies who make most of the products have always had
the markets edge because they have the most visibility and customer goodwill
because they are publicly known. However, with the Web becoming the major
market, the small companies can now compete by promoting themselves and
becoming efficient online. This is one of the reasons that artists are
stepping into the web space and taking advantage of its exposure. Yes there is
potential for more money, but the truth of the matter is that the record
labels are way behind the times and the artists need to keep up with where the
demand is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the major organizations of western culture have been falling behind
due to the presence of the Web. They have built their business on the idea
that they can force feed the consumer what they want to produce and they will
be able to control the market. This type of thinking is quickly being phased
out as a larger majority of people begin to express their opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the overall theme of your article. You have a very
Industrial Age perspective of the Web and because of this I feel that in many
cases you are missing the point. You have criticized the fact that there are
so many opinions online and have questioned any good to be had from it. I see
it from a completely different perspective. The Web is one of the best
learning tools we currently have because there are so many opinions to be
heard. In this ever changing world we need diversity of thought and to become
less dependent on the force feeding establishments of the Industrial Age, such
as government, the education system, corporate mass media and big business.
Most of these organizations are falling way behind because they do not
understand how to adapt to the changes of the last 20 years. The educational
system, for example, is meant to be teaching our youth and training them for
the future, but the system itself is stuck without almost any understanding of
the future. They are still teaching from the perspective of; this is what the
big businesses do in your field, learn it to become their employee. The way
they should be teaching is; this is what the big businesses do in your field,
learn it to be able to improve it. Creativity and diversity of thought needs
to be brought back into the classroom if students are to be ready for the
world upon graduation. This is only one example, but the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web is here to stay and it is changing the way that people communicate, do
business and express them selves. There are advancements in almost every field
every day and because of the Web you can keep your self up to date, improve
your ideas and open your mind to new levels of creativity.&lt;br /&gt;
I feel that we need to embrace the Web for what it is and learn to use it to
improve our selves and the way we think. It is one of the most amazing tools
available to the majority of the population and should not be passed off as an
inconsequential web of mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will&lt;/p&gt;

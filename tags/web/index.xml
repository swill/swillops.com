      <title>From the beginning...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started working with web based development and design when I was 16. I
started out working mainly with graphic design and then moving more towards
web development as I got closer to heading off to university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005 I got my bachelors degree from McGill University in Computer Science.
I had done quite a bit of freelance work with the web while I was in school,
but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really considering it as a career at the time. I thought it would
be smart to become a &amp;ldquo;developer&amp;rdquo; rather than a &amp;ldquo;web developer&amp;rdquo;, so when I
graduated I started working for a pretty big company coding in C# on .NET. It
didn&amp;rsquo;t take me long to realize that I don&amp;rsquo;t think the way that &amp;lsquo;versioned&amp;rsquo;
software developers think. Added to that, this was my first experience working
with a big company. I had no control over our shipped product, I was just a
cog in a big (inefficient) machine. I realized that I had not become a
&amp;ldquo;developer&amp;rdquo; at all, but a &amp;ldquo;programmer&amp;rdquo;. You may be thinking that there is no
difference between the two, so let me clarify my point. I was once told, &amp;ldquo;a
software developer is like a poet or a painter. They all start with a blank
piece of paper and their only limit is their imagination&amp;rdquo;. I find this very
true. As a software developer you are dealing directly with a client and you
are working together with them to solve their problems in the best way
possible. By intimately understanding the clients needs you have more freedom
to be creative and build an elegant solution. On the flip side, as a
programmer you have very little freedom. You are given a strict set of
specifications that need to be implemented and your job is to build it. The
problem is, most of the time this set of specifications has gone through about
6 levels of documentation, from a high level estimate all the way down to the
technical spec document that you were handed. The client is often only
consulted for the first half of that documentation process, so it is very
possible that right from the beginning you are not even building what the
client needs. Of course, when the client is not happy with the end result, the
programmer takes all the flak. Being a very entrepreneurial person, this
setting really was not working out for me. I began looking into the web
environment again because I had always enjoyed working in that field. In my
research to get caught up with all the new happenings in this industry I
realized that my year and a half away from web development had put me way
behind. I knew right away that I was in the wrong industry and started taking
steps to correct my previous decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: I have quit my job and started working for a small company as a web
developer and it has been amazing. I work too much now days, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be
happier&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Re:Web of Mediocrity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Juan Rodriguez wrote an article in the Montreal Gazette titled the &amp;lsquo;Web of
Mediocrity&amp;rsquo; which I found somewhat obtuse. Here is my response to that
article.&lt;br /&gt;
(The article is only available online for paying members, so you will have had
to have read it in paper form for proper context&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Rodriguez,&lt;br /&gt;
I read your article in the gazette and I have some contentions with your
arguments/opinions. I have a very different view on the topic, so I wanted to
present my understanding of the Web and its effect on our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where should I start? I guess we might as well put a time frame on this so we
are talking about the same thing. The Web was created almost 20 years ago and
has been growing at an amazing rate. It has pretty much defined our transition
from the Industrial Age to the Information Age. It allows for the sharing of
ideas on all levels quickly and efficiently. Because of this, the Web has
attracted audiences of all types. Businesses can run smoother, teachers can
better educate and pretty much any old Joe can share their knowledge,
creativity and opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does this shape our culture and society? I think that the economy plays
one of the biggest roles in shaping a society, so lets look at that to start.
When you think of the Web and economics, the first thing that probably comes
to mind is the &amp;ldquo;dot com&amp;rdquo; era/bust around the year 2000. A lot of companies
realized that they needed to be &amp;ldquo;web enabled&amp;rdquo; and ran full force into it
without really understanding how web enabled businesses function. Because of
this many companies bought or developed very poor solutions to their problems
and ran into major issues when their chosen software couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep up with the
changing technology and market. Many companies went broke while a lot of
companies ended up squeaking by without getting hit too hard and took the
experience as an expensive web tutorial. There were a few companies who
understood the changing times and capitalized on the market, and the likes of
Google, Amazon and eBay were born. These companies understood the concept of
Software as a Service (SaaS) and built web frameworks to capitalize on the
huge demanding market of consumers who where itching to be served by the web.
These companies have become household names but the full potential of the web
is not limited to there achievements. Every day new companies are starting to
understand the Web&amp;rsquo;s potential and begin working to ensure their spot in the
growing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand why the Web is changing the rules, I have to discuss for
a minute &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail&#34;&gt;Long Tail&lt;/a&gt; economics
(and yes I just linked a wikipedia page). The Long Tail refers to the fact
that only a few companies make most of today&amp;rsquo;s products and a very large
number of companies only make a small number of products (these companies are
the long tail). The companies who make most of the products have always had
the markets edge because they have the most visibility and customer goodwill
because they are publicly known. However, with the Web becoming the major
market, the small companies can now compete by promoting themselves and
becoming efficient online. This is one of the reasons that artists are
stepping into the web space and taking advantage of its exposure. Yes there is
potential for more money, but the truth of the matter is that the record
labels are way behind the times and the artists need to keep up with where the
demand is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the major organizations of western culture have been falling behind
due to the presence of the Web. They have built their business on the idea
that they can force feed the consumer what they want to produce and they will
be able to control the market. This type of thinking is quickly being phased
out as a larger majority of people begin to express their opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the overall theme of your article. You have a very
Industrial Age perspective of the Web and because of this I feel that in many
cases you are missing the point. You have criticized the fact that there are
so many opinions online and have questioned any good to be had from it. I see
it from a completely different perspective. The Web is one of the best
learning tools we currently have because there are so many opinions to be
heard. In this ever changing world we need diversity of thought and to become
less dependent on the force feeding establishments of the Industrial Age, such
as government, the education system, corporate mass media and big business.
Most of these organizations are falling way behind because they do not
understand how to adapt to the changes of the last 20 years. The educational
system, for example, is meant to be teaching our youth and training them for
the future, but the system itself is stuck without almost any understanding of
the future. They are still teaching from the perspective of; this is what the
big businesses do in your field, learn it to become their employee. The way
they should be teaching is; this is what the big businesses do in your field,
learn it to be able to improve it. Creativity and diversity of thought needs
to be brought back into the classroom if students are to be ready for the
world upon graduation. This is only one example, but the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Web is here to stay and it is changing the way that people communicate, do
business and express them selves. There are advancements in almost every field
every day and because of the Web you can keep your self up to date, improve
your ideas and open your mind to new levels of creativity.&lt;br /&gt;
I feel that we need to embrace the Web for what it is and learn to use it to
improve our selves and the way we think. It is one of the most amazing tools
available to the majority of the population and should not be passed off as an
inconsequential web of mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will&lt;/p&gt;
